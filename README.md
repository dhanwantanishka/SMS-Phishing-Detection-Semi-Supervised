# SMS-Phishing-Detection-Semi-Supervised
## SpamGAN
This repository was created in order to try and implement a SpamGAN. <br>
A generative adversarial network which relies on limited set of labeled data as well as unlabeled data for opinion spam detection. <br>
<br>
The SpamGAN algorithm offers a way in which we can artificially generate new data to incease our dataset and allow the base algorithm to improve.
This algorithm conssits of a fine-tuned GPT2 model that generates new text and also several trained supervised classification algorithms (as mentioned in the diagram below).

SpamGAN aims to improve the machine-learning algorithms by attending to the issue of limited data in the area of SMS-Phishing. 

## Requirements:
* Transformers
* Pytorch
* Matplotlib

## Steps to run this repository:
* GPT folder holds the code to generating a fine-tuned GPT2 model that can create SMS messages based on our limited dataset.
Refer to the folder and attend readme to generate the model.
* After generating the new model, we can then pass it into the SpamGAN folder.
* Run the classification algorithms in order to generate the pretrained supervised learning models
* Run the Dataset generation file to generate and classify the new data
* Repeat until necessary.
